        <h2>Useful Tips for Working at Home</h2>
        <h3>Learning Area</h3>
        <p>Have a dedicated learning/workspace, even if it is a multiuse space. It’s important that you know and become familiar with a dedicated learning/workspace.</p>
        <h3>Structure</h3>
        <p>Create a mindset that acknowledges that this is not an extended holiday but a formal learning process. To help achieve this, you should provide clear structure, such as a timetable or daily goals. It can be useful to roughly mimic your normal schedule. However, don’t forget to take breaks and even reward yourself when you reach a milestone (i.e. I’ll speak to a friend for 10 minutes).</p>
        <h3>Set Realistic Goals and Deadlines</h3>
        <p>It’s important to challenge yourself, but counterproductive if you set unrealistic objectives. Setting goals that you can reasonably achieve will enable you to be more effective across the bredth of your studies / work over a long period of time.</p>
        <h3>Limit Distractions</h3>
        <p>Remove or disable any distractions that are present in the learning space. For example, put devices away and unplug your television if in the same space. If you have children or siblings, agree clear boundaries with them about work time vs. family time.</p>
        <h3>Software</h3>
        <p>If you are being provided with online classes or use different platforms for virtual meetings, ensure that you have the correct software in advance. This will avoid the frustration of being all set to begin your work, only to spend half an hour downloading and installing the correct software.</p>
        <h3>Superwoman/Superman Syndrome</h3>
        <p>Don’t fall into the trap of thinking that every aspect of your home can be perfect at all times. You, your children and your spouse will be occupying the same space all day, every day, for months. So, don’t be disheartened by the fact that the new arrangement will impact your homes normal regime.</p>
        <h3>Robot Syndrome</h3>
        <p>You are not a robot! We all have slow days, exceptional days and most often land somewhere in the middle. If your workplan is not working or the atmosphere is becoming too frustrating, don’t be afraid to park the subject for another day or to take a break.</p>

          <h2>What help is available from the government during the COVID-19 pandemic</h1>
              
          <p>Many of us will be facing some hardships owing to the current situation with the Coronavirus pandemic.
          Below is some useful guidance and links to the support that the Government has outlined for the population. </p>
          <ul>
              <li>The chancellor has announced that the Government is setting up a job retention scheme and employers can get a grant to cover 80% of wages up to a maximum of £2500 a month. 
                  This will be backdated from 1st March and will initially last for 3 months. To be setup by end of April</li>
              <li>Business interruption loan scheme is a government backed loan scheme where affected businesses can apply for loans which will be interest free for 12 months. 
                  This is going live on Monday 23rd March.</li>
              <li>Businesses will be able to defer VAT payments due for this July to the end of the financial year.</li>
              <li>For self employed people the next self-assessment payment will be deferred to January 2021, they will also get full Universal Credit at a rate equivalent to statutory sick pay.</li>
              <li>For those off work due to self-isolation, statutory sick pay is now available from the 1st day off from work.</li>
              <li>A further £7 Billion to be injected to those relying on welfare support (through Universal Credit).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>For more information and the application process please follow this link <a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus">https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus</a>
          Above is very useful guidance outlined by the government but the main help which we derive is through prayer. 
          Hazoor (aba) mentioned in his Friday Sermon on Friday 20th March… “The ultimate tool we have at our disposal is that of prayer. 
          We should all pray for the entire world that Allah the Almighty may save mankind from the harmful effects of this virus. 
          Furthermore, may Allah grant health to all Ahmadi Muslims alongside the ability to become stronger in faith”
          With the passing of his father, the Promised Messiah (as) was faced with some financial challenges. 
          It was at that point that Allah the Almighty revealed to him the Blessed ilham: “Is not Allah sufficient for his servant?”. 
          In these difficult times we must remember that we are Blessed with the guidance of our beloved Hazoor (aba) and listening and obeying him, for the sake of Allah, will help to shield us from potential hardships. 
          Indeed, Allah is all we need and His pleasure is truly our ultimate objective.</p>

                  Under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, all UK employers will be able to access support to continue paying part of their employees’ salary for those employees that would otherwise have been laid off during this crisis.

          <h3>Support for businesses who are paying sick pay to employees</h3>
              <p>
                  We will bring forward legislation to allow small-and medium-sized businesses and employers to reclaim Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) paid for sickness absence due to COVID-19. 
                  The eligibility criteria for the scheme will be as follows:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>this refund will cover up to 2 weeks’ SSP per eligible employee who has been off work because of COVID-19</li>
                      <li>employers with fewer than 250 employees will be eligible - the size of an employer will be determined by the number of people they employed as of 28 February 2020</li>
                      <li>employers will be able to reclaim expenditure for any employee who has claimed SSP (according to the new eligibility criteria) as a result of COVID-19</li>
                      <li>employers should maintain records of staff absences and payments of SSP, but employees will not need to provide a GP fit note. 
                          If evidence is required by an employer, those with symptoms of coronavirus can get an isolation note from <a href="https://www.websmithsemailmarketer.com/link.php?M=1184266&amp;N=17450&amp;L=48113&amp;F=H">NHS 111 online</a> 
                          and those who live with someone that has symptoms can get a note from the <a href="https://www.websmithsemailmarketer.com/link.php?M=1184266&amp;N=17450&amp;L=48106&amp;F=H">NHS website</a></li>
                      <li>eligible period for the scheme will commence the day after the regulations on the extension of SSP to those staying at home comes into force</li>
                      <li>the government will work with employers over the coming months to set up the repayment mechanism for employers as soon as possible</li>
                  </ul>

          <h5>Eligibility</h5>
              <p>
                  You are eligible for the scheme if:	</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>your business is UK based</li>
                      <li>your business is a small or medium-sized and employs fewer than 250 employees as of 28 February 2020</li>
                  </ul>


          <h5>How to access the scheme</h5>
              <p>

          <h3>Support for businesses through the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme</h3>
              <P>
                  A new temporary Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, delivered by the British Business Bank, will launch early next week to support primarily small and medium-sized businesses to access bank lending and overdrafts.
                  The government will provide lenders with a guarantee of 80% on each loan (subject to a per-lender cap on claims) to give lenders further confidence in continuing to provide finance to SMEs. 
                  The government will not charge businesses or banks for this guarantee, and the Scheme will support loans of up to £5 million in value.
                  Businesses can access the first 12 months of that finance interest free, as the government will cover the first 12 months of interest payments.
              </P>

          <h5>Eligibility</h5>
              <P>
                  You are eligible for the scheme if:
                  <ul>
                      <li>your business is UK based, with turnover of no more than £45 million per year</li>
                      <li>your business meets the other British Business Bank eligibility criteria</li>
                  </ul>
              </P>

          <h5>How to access the scheme</h5>
              <P>
                  The full rules of the Scheme and the list of accredited lenders is available on the <a href="https://www.websmithsemailmarketer.com/link.php?M=1184266&amp;N=17450&amp;L=48112&amp;F=H">British Business Bank website</a>. 
                  All the major banks will offer the Scheme once it has launched. There are 40 accredited providers in all.
                  You should talk to your bank or finance provider (not the British Business Bank) as soon as possible and discuss your business plan with them. 
                  This will help your finance provider to act quickly once the Scheme has launched. 
                  If you have an existing loan with monthly repayments you may want to ask for a repayment holiday to help with cash flow.
                  The scheme will be available from early next week commencing 23 March.
