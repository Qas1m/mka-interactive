        <h1>What help is available from the government during the COVID-19 pandemic</h1>
        <p>Many of us will be facing some hardships owing to the current situation with the Coronavirus pandemic. </p>
        <p>Below is some useful guidance and links to the support that the Government has outlined for the population.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The chancellor has announced that the Government is setting up a job retention scheme and employers can get a grant to cover 80% of wages up to a maximum of &pound;2500 a month. This will be backdated from 1st March and will initially last for 3 months. To be setup by end of April</li>
            <li>Business interruption loan scheme is a government backed loan scheme where affected businesses can apply for loans which will be interest free for 12 months. This is going live on Monday 23rd March.</li>
            <li>Businesses will be able to defer VAT payments due for this July to the end of the financial year.</li>
            <li>For self employed people the next self-assessment payment will be deferred to January 2021, they will also get full Universal Credit at a rate equivalent to statutory sick pay.</li>
            <li>For those off work due to self-isolation, statutory sick pay is now available from the 1st day off from work.</li>
            <li>A further &pound;7 Billion to be injected to those relying on welfare support (through Universal Credit).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For more information and the application process please follow this link <a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus">https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus</a> </p>
        <p>Above is very useful guidance outlined by the government but the main help which we derive is through prayer. Hazoor (aba) mentioned in his Friday Sermon on Friday 20th March&hellip; &ldquo;The ultimate tool we have at our disposal is that of prayer. We should all pray for the entire world that Allah the Almighty may save mankind from the harmful effects of this virus. Furthermore, may Allah grant health to all Ahmadi Muslims alongside the ability to become stronger in faith&rdquo;</p>
        <p>With the passing of his father, the Promised Messiah (as) was faced with some financial challenges. It was at that point that Allah the Almighty revealed to him the Blessed ilham: &ldquo;Is not Allah sufficient for his servant?&rdquo;. In these difficult times we must remember that we are Blessed with the guidance of our beloved Hazoor (aba) and listening and obeying him, for the sake of Allah, will help to shield us from potential hardships. Indeed, Allah is all we need and His pleasure is truly our ultimate objective.</p>
        <h1>COVID-19: support for businesses</h1>

        <h2>Support for businesses through the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme</h2>
        <p>Under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, all UK employers will be able to access support to continue paying part of their employees’ salary for those employees that would otherwise have been laid off during this crisis.</p>
        <h3><strong>Eligibility</strong></h3>
        <p>All UK businesses are eligible.</p>
        <h3><strong>How to access the scheme</strong></h3>
        <p>You will need to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>designate affected employees as &lsquo;furloughed workers,’ and notify your employees of this change - changing the status of employees remains subject to existing employment law and, depending on the employment contract, may be subject to negotiation</strong></li>
            <li><strong>submit information to HMRC about the employees that have been furloughed and their earnings through a new online portal (HMRC will set out further details on the information required)</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>HMRC will reimburse 80% of furloughed workers wage costs, up to a cap of &pound;2,500 per month. HMRC are working urgently to set up a system for reimbursement. Existing systems are not set up to facilitate payments to employers.</strong></p>
        <p>If your business needs short term cash flow support, you may be eligible for a <a href="https://www.websmithsemailmarketer.com/link.php?M=1184266&amp;N=17450&amp;L=48107&amp;F=H">Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan</a>.</p>
        <h2>Support for businesses through deferring VAT and Income Tax payments</h2>
        <p>We will support businesses by deferring Valued Added Tax (VAT) payments for 3 months. If you’re self-employed, Income Tax payments due in July 2020 under the Self-Assessment system will be deferred to January 2021.</p>
        <h3><strong>VAT</strong></h3>
        <p>For VAT, the deferral will apply from 20 March 2020 until 30 June 2020.</p>
        <h4><strong>Eligibility</strong></h4>
        <p>All UK businesses are eligible.</p>
        <h4><strong>How to access the scheme</strong></h4>
        <p>This is an automatic offer with no applications required. Businesses will not need to make a VAT payment during this period. Taxpayers will be given until the end of the 2020 to 2021 tax year to pay any liabilities that have accumulated during the deferral period. VAT refunds and reclaims will be paid by the government as normal.</p>
        <h3><strong>Income Tax</strong></h3>
        <p>For Income Tax Self-Assessment, payments due on the 31 July 2020 will be deferred until the 31 January 2021.</p>

        <h2>Support for businesses who are paying sick pay to employees</h2>
        <p>We will bring forward legislation to allow small-and medium-sized businesses and employers to reclaim Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) paid for sickness absence due to COVID-19. The eligibility criteria for the scheme will be as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>this refund will cover up to 2 weeks’ SSP per eligible employee who has been off work because of COVID-19</li>
            <li>employers with fewer than 250 employees will be eligible - the size of an employer will be determined by the number of people they employed as of 28 February 2020</li>
            <li>employers will be able to reclaim expenditure for any employee who has claimed SSP (according to the new eligibility criteria) as a result of COVID-19</li>
            <li>employers should maintain records of staff absences and payments of SSP, but employees will not need to provide a GP fit note. If evidence is required by an employer, those with symptoms of coronavirus can get an isolation note from <a href="https://www.websmithsemailmarketer.com/link.php?M=1184266&amp;N=17450&amp;L=48113&amp;F=H">NHS 111 online</a> and those who live with someone that has symptoms can get a note from the <a href="https://www.websmithsemailmarketer.com/link.php?M=1184266&amp;N=17450&amp;L=48106&amp;F=H">NHS website</a></li>
            <li>eligible period for the scheme will commence the day after the regulations on the extension of SSP to those staying at home comes into force</li>
            <li>the government will work with employers over the coming months to set up the repayment mechanism for employers as soon as possible</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong>Eligibility</strong></h3>
        <p>You are eligible for the scheme if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>your business is UK based</li>
            <li>your business is a small or medium-sized and employs fewer than 250 employees as of 28 February 2020</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong>How to access the scheme</strong></h3>
        <p>A rebate scheme is being developed. Further details will be provided in due course once the legislation has passed.</p>
        <h2>Support for businesses that pay business rates</h2>
        <h3><strong>Business rates holiday for retail, hospitality and leisure businesses</strong></h3>
        <p>We will introduce a business rates holiday for retail, hospitality and leisure businesses in England for the 2020 to 2021 tax year.</p>
        <p>Businesses that received the retail discount in the 2019 to 2020 tax year will be rebilled by their local authority as soon as possible.</p>
        <h4><strong>Eligibility</strong></h4>

        <h4><strong>How to access the scheme</strong></h4>
        <p>There is no action for you. This will apply to your next council tax bill in April 2020. However, local authorities may have to reissue your bill automatically to exclude the business rate charge. They will do this as soon as possible.</p>

        <h2>Support for businesses through the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme</h2>
        <p>A new temporary Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, delivered by the British Business Bank, will launch early next week to support primarily small and medium-sized businesses to access bank lending and overdrafts.</p>
        <p>The government will provide lenders with a guarantee of 80% on each loan (subject to a per-lender cap on claims) to give lenders further confidence in continuing to provide finance to SMEs. The government will not charge businesses or banks for this guarantee, and the Scheme will support loans of up to &pound;5 million in value.</p>
        <p>Businesses can access the first 12 months of that finance interest free, as the government will cover the first 12 months of interest payments.</p>
        <h3><strong>Eligibility</strong></h3>
        <p>You are eligible for the scheme if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>your business is UK based, with turnover of no more than &pound;45 million per year</li>
            <li>your business meets the other British Business Bank eligibility criteria</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong>How to access the scheme</strong></h3>
        <p>The full rules of the Scheme and the list of accredited lenders is available on the <a href="https://www.websmithsemailmarketer.com/link.php?M=1184266&amp;N=17450&amp;L=48112&amp;F=H">British Business Bank website</a>. All the major banks will offer the Scheme once it has launched. There are 40 accredited providers in all.</p>
        <p>You should talk to your bank or finance provider (not the British Business Bank) as soon as possible and discuss your business plan with them. This will help your finance provider to act quickly once the Scheme has launched. If you have an existing loan with monthly repayments you may want to ask for a repayment holiday to help with cash flow.</p>
        <p>The scheme will be available from early next week commencing 23 March.</p>
        <h2>Support for businesses paying tax: Time to Pay service</h2>
